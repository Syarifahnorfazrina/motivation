<h3><u> I Can Spend Time With Family Plus Studying </u> </h3> 
<p> I can just simply log in to the virtual campus from the comfort of my own house. </p>
<p> Even I am at my own house, i still can learn and study with my lecturer and friends. </p>

<h3><u> Online Learning Requires Less of a Time Investment </h3></u>
<p>It involves the time to get back and forth to classes, plus the time spent waiting for tutors and other students if it is not online classes. </p>


<h3><u> More Interaction And Greater Ability <del>To</del> For the Students To Concentrate </u></h3>

<p> Online courses offer shy or more reticent students the opportunity to participate in class discussions more easily than face-to-face class sessions. Some students even report <mark> better concentration </mark> in online classes due to the lack of classroom activity. </p>




<h3><u> Avoid Commuting </h3></u>

<p> Rather than miss important class sessions, students in online courses can always "attend" by participating in discussion boards or chat sessions, turning in their work on time, and watching lectures or reading materials. </p>
